Reference: [Let LLMs Take on the Latest Challenges! A Chinese Dynamic Question Answering Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19248)

We calculate the ratio of common tokens between model generated responses and ground truth to the ground truth. Specifically, we first segment the generated text and golden text into token lists using word segmentation tools, then calculate the ratio of tokens generated by models belonging to the golden token list to golden tokens.
